**Release Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: READY FOR PRODUCTION  
**PyPI**: Ready to publish

## üéØ Overview

The first production release of music21-mcp-server brings professional music analysis and generation capabilities to Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible platforms. This release represents months of development, optimization, and hardening for production use.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 16 Powerful Music Analysis Tools
- **Import/Export**: Support for MusicXML, MIDI, ABC, PDF, and more
- **Analysis**: Key detection, harmony analysis, chord progressions, voice leading
- **Generation**: Harmonization (classical/jazz/pop/modal), counterpoint, style imitation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic pattern detection
- **Score Management**: Efficient resource management with TTL caching

### üé® Hidden Gems Now Exposed
Three previously hidden high-value tools are now available:
1. **harmonize_melody**: Generate 4-part harmonizations in multiple styles
2. **generate_counterpoint**: Create species counterpoint following traditional rules  
3. **imitate_style**: Generate music in the style of Bach, Mozart, or Chopin

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **2x faster**: Performance cache with 7200s TTL
- **Roman numeral analysis**: 14.7s ‚Üí <1s via intelligent caching
- **Parallel processing**: ThreadPoolExecutor for non-blocking operations
- **Memory efficient**: Advanced memory management prevents leaks

### üîí Security Enhancements
- **Path traversal protection**: Validated file paths prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Network binding**: Changed from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 for localhost-only access
- **Hash security**: Fixed MD5 deprecation warnings with usedforsecurity=False

### üì¶ Desktop Extension (.dxt)
- **One-click installation**: No Python setup required
- **Automatic configuration**: Claude Desktop settings updated automatically

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive timeout mechanisms (30s default, configurable)
- ‚úÖ Proper async/await patterns throughout
- ‚úÖ Resource cleanup with context managers
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling with detailed messages

### Testing & Coverage
- 60+ unit tests with ~80% coverage
- Integration tests for all tools

- Continuous monitoring capabilities

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with examples
- 8 workflow templates for common use cases
- API documentation for all tools
- Desktop Extension installation guide

## üìä Statistics

- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000
- **Test Coverage**: ~80%
- **Dependencies**: 18 (all production-ready)
- **Package Size**: 118KB (wheel), 102KB (source)
- **Python Support**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- **License**: MIT

## üöÄ Installation

### Via PyPI (Available after publication)
```bash
pip install music21-mcp-server
```

### Via Desktop Extension
1. Download `music21-mcp-server-1.0.0.dxt` from Releases
2. Double-click to install
3. Restart Claude Desktop

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brightlikethelight/music21-mcp-server.git
cd music21-mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

## üîÑ Migration from Pre-1.0

If upgrading from a pre-release version:
1. Uninstall old version: `pip uninstall music21-mcp-server`
2. Install new version: `pip install music21-mcp-server`
3. Update Claude Desktop configuration (or use Desktop Extension)

## üêõ Known Issues

- Music21 corpus download can be slow on first use (one-time operation)
- PDF export requires external software (MuseScore or Lilypond)
- Some complex scores may take >5s to analyze (use timeouts appropriately)

## üôè Acknowledgments

- MIT's music21 team for the incredible music analysis library
- Anthropic for the Model Context Protocol specification
- FastMCP developers for the efficient Python implementation
- Early testers and contributors from the MCP community
